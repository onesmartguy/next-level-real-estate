## 🎯 How to Upload to ElevenLabs

### Option 1: Individual Documents (Recommended)

Upload each document separately to ElevenLabs knowledge base:

1. Log into ElevenLabs Dashboard
2. Navigate to your Agent (Sarah)
3. Go to Knowledge Base section
4. Upload each .md file individually:
   - `01-cash-offer-vs-traditional-sale.md`
   - `02-common-homeowner-situations.md`
   - `03-downsizing-benefits-guide.md`
   - `04-objection-handling-expanded.md`
   - `05-conversation-examples.md`

**Advantages**:
- Agent can reference specific documents more easily
- Easier to update individual sections
- Better organization

### Option 2: Combined Document

If ElevenLabs has a document limit, combine all into one:

```bash
cat 01-*.md 02-*.md 03-*.md 04-*.md 05-*.md > COMPLETE_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md
```

**Note**: Check ElevenLabs file size limits (typically 10-50MB per file).

## 💡 Best Practices for Knowledge Upload

### 1. Test Incrementally

Start with 1-2 documents and test:
- Does Sarah reference the knowledge correctly?
- Is response time still acceptable?
- Is the information being used naturally?

### 2. Monitor Performance

After uploading, monitor:
- Does Sarah sound more informed?
- Are objection responses better?
- Is qualification more accurate?
- Are appointments setting at higher rate?

### 3. Update Regularly

As you learn from real conversations:
- Add new objections and responses
- Update conversation examples
- Add new scenarios encountered
- Refine scripts based on what works

**Recommended Update Frequency**: Monthly

### 4. Version Control

Keep track of knowledge base versions:
- Tag each update with date
- Document what changed
- Track performance before/after updates
- Maintain changelog

---

## 🔧 Optimization Tips

### Prompt Structure

When referencing knowledge in Sarah's system prompt, include:

```
Knowledge Base Instructions:
- Reference knowledge documents to provide accurate, detailed information
- Use specific examples from conversation examples when relevant
- Adapt objection responses to the specific homeowner's situation
- Always verify information from knowledge base before stating as fact
- If unsure, say "Let me verify that for you" rather than guessing
```

### Knowledge Retrieval

Optimize how Sarah uses the knowledge:

```
Retrieval Strategy:
- When homeowner raises objection → Reference objection handling guide
- When discussing downsizing → Reference benefits guide
- When comparing options → Reference cash offer vs traditional guide
- When identifying situation → Reference common situations guide
- When uncertain about flow → Reference conversation examples
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### What Knowledge Base Can't Do

- **Can't override system prompt**: System prompt still sets personality and tone
- **Can't guarantee usage**: Agent might not always reference knowledge appropriately
- **Can't replace dynamic context**: Still need to inject property-specific details
- **Can't update in real-time**: Must manually update documents

### Compliance Reminder

Knowledge base includes:
- ✅ TCPA compliance information
- ✅ Ethical guidelines
- ✅ Honest objection responses
- ✅ When to disengage
- ✅ DNC list respect

Ensure Sarah's system prompt also emphasizes compliance.
