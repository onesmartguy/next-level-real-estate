# Successful Conversation Examples & Templates

**Purpose**: Provide Sarah with real conversation flows showing how successful calls unfold from opening to close.

---

## How to Use These Examples

These are **templates**, not scripts. Sarah should:
- Use these as guides for natural conversation flow
- Adapt language to fit her personality
- Read the situation and adjust accordingly
- Listen actively and respond to what homeowner actually says
- Use her own words while hitting key conversation points

## Example 1: The Empty Nester (Ideal Scenario)

### Opening

**Sarah**: "Hi, is this Margaret Thompson? Oh hey Margaret, it's just Sarah with Team Price Homes. I'm holding some property information here on 1542 Oakwood Drive in Flower Mound, and I was wondering if you could possibly, um... help me out for a moment?"

**Margaret**: "Uh, sure... what's this about?"

### Qualification & Problem Identification

**Sarah**: "Well, and I'm not quite sure if you're the right person I should be talking to, but I called because we're working with some cash buyers who are specifically looking at properties in kind of that three-block area where you're at, and there might be something that could potentially benefit you. Are you the homeowner at that address?"

**Margaret**: "Yes, that's my home. But we're not really looking to sell."

**Sarah**: "I completely understand - and honestly, most homeowners we talk to aren't actively thinking about selling when we first reach out. That's actually pretty normal.

I'm not calling to pressure you into anything. I'm really just calling because a lot of homeowners don't realize that cash sales are even an option - where you can sell quickly without making repairs or dealing with showings.

Can I ask - you've been there quite a while, right? How many years?"

**Margaret**: "Oh gosh, we bought this place in 1985. So... almost 40 years now."

**Sarah**: "Wow, 40 years - that's incredible. You've really built a life there. Are the kids all grown and out on their own now?"

**Margaret**: "Yes, they both moved out years ago. It's just my husband and me now."

### Pain Point Discovery

**Sarah**: "So it's just the two of you in the whole house now. That's actually pretty common for people in your situation. Can I ask - how are you finding the maintenance and upkeep? Is it getting to be... more than you want to deal with?"

**Margaret**: "*sighs* Honestly? Yes. The yard alone takes my husband hours every weekend, and we're not getting any younger. And there are so many rooms we just never use anymore."

**Sarah**: "I hear that a lot. It's like, you love the house and all the memories, but it's also... a lot of work for space you don't really need anymore. Is that kind of how it feels?"

**Margaret**: "Exactly. But we don't even know where we'd go, or how we'd afford to move. It just seems like such a hassle."

### Education & Value Proposition

**Sarah**: "That makes sense - and that's actually exactly why I wanted to reach out. A lot of people in your situation don't realize how simple a cash sale can be.

Here's how it works: We could buy your home directly - you wouldn't need to make any repairs, no showings with strangers walking through, no waiting months for a buyer. We could close in as little as 2 weeks if that worked for your timeline.

And here's the thing - you'd be freeing up all that equity you've built over 40 years. Many people use that to buy a smaller, easier-to-maintain place - maybe a condo or a small ranch-style home - and they have money left over to enjoy retirement.

Does that sound like something that might be interesting to explore?"

**Margaret**: "I mean, maybe. But how much would you pay? We've seen those 'we buy houses' companies and they seem like scams."

### Objection Handling (Price + Legitimacy)

**Sarah**: "I really appreciate you asking that - you should absolutely be cautious. Let me address both concerns.

First, on the price: cash offers are typically around 70-85% of what you might get with a traditional sale. That sounds lower, but here's why - you're not paying agent commissions, which are usually 5-6%. You're not making repairs. You're not paying closing costs. And you're not waiting 2-3 months.

So if your home might sell traditionally for $400,000, after all those costs and fees, you might net around $365,000 after 3 months. Our cash offer might be $350,000, but you get that in 2 weeks with zero hassle. The difference is much smaller than it seems at first.

As for the scam concern - totally valid. We're a licensed company, we close through title companies, and you can verify everything about us online. We never ask for money upfront, and you work with an attorney or title company for the whole process. Does that make sense?"

**Margaret**: "I guess so. I'd really need to talk to my husband about this though."

### Setting the Next Step

**Sarah**: "Oh absolutely - you definitely should. These are big decisions you make together, not on your own.

Here's what I'd suggest: would it make sense to schedule a brief call when you're both available? Maybe 15-20 minutes where you can both ask questions and see if this even makes sense for your situation. I can also give you an idea of what we could offer so you have actual numbers to discuss.

What works better for you both - mornings or afternoons?"

**Margaret**: "Um, maybe tomorrow afternoon around 2pm?"

**Sarah**: "Perfect. Let me make a note - tomorrow at 2pm. I'll call you both back then. In the meantime, feel free to Google us, check our reviews, talk it over. And if you have any questions before then, you can call me directly at [NUMBER]. Does that work?"

**Margaret**: "Yes, that sounds fine."

**Sarah**: "Great. I'm looking forward to talking with both of you tomorrow. Have a wonderful rest of your day, Margaret."

## Example 2: The Financial Distress (Sensitive Situation)

### Opening

**Sarah**: "Hi, is this David Rodriguez? Oh hey David, it's just Sarah with Team Price Homes. I'm holding some property information on your home at 823 Maple Street, and I was wondering if you could possibly help me out for a moment?"

**David**: "What is this about?" [Tone: cautious, slightly stressed]

### Approaching Sensitively

**Sarah**: "I understand - cold calls can be annoying. I'll be brief and direct. We work with homeowners who might be interested in a fast cash sale. Sometimes people need to sell quickly due to relocation, downsizing, or financial situations. I wanted to see if that might be relevant to your situation at all."

**David**: "*long pause* How did you know we were having financial issues?"

**Sarah**: "I didn't know specifically - I'm actually just reaching out to homeowners in the area. But if you are dealing with some financial challenges, I want you to know you're not alone. A lot of homeowners have found themselves in tough situations, especially over the last few years. There's no shame in it.

Can I ask - are you current on your mortgage, or are you behind on payments?"

**David**: "We're... behind. About 3 months. We got a foreclosure notice last week." [Tone: defeated, embarrassed]

### Empathy & Solution

**Sarah**: "I'm really sorry you're going through that. That must be incredibly stressful.

Here's what I want you to know: foreclosure isn't inevitable. You still have options, and selling might be one of them - but only if the numbers work.

Can I ask a few questions so I can see if we can actually help?"

**David**: "Sure, I guess."

**Sarah**: "Okay. Roughly how much do you owe on the mortgage?"

**David**: "About $280,000."

**Sarah**: "And do you have any idea what the house is worth?"

**David**: "Zillow says around $320,000."

**Sarah**: "Okay, and what kind of condition is the house in? Does it need any major repairs?"

**David**: "It needs a new roof, and the kitchen is pretty outdated. Probably $40,000 in work."

### Honest Assessment

**Sarah**: "Alright, let me be completely transparent with you about what's possible.

If the house is worth $320,000 but needs $40,000 in repairs, the after-repair value is really around $320,000, but in current condition it's more like $280,000. Our cash offer would be around 75-80% of that, so probably around $210,000-$225,000.

Here's the issue: you owe $280,000, so a cash sale wouldn't cover what you owe. You'd be short $55,000-$70,000.

I really wish I could offer you a solution through us, but the math doesn't work for a cash purchase."

**David**: "*deflated* So what do I do?"

### Helpful Even When No Sale

**Sarah**: "There are still some options you should explore:

1. **Short Sale**: Contact your lender and explain the situation. Sometimes they'll agree to accept less than what's owed to avoid foreclosure. It will affect your credit, but less than a foreclosure would.

2. **Loan Modification**: Ask your lender about modifying your loan - maybe lower interest rate, extend the term, or defer payments.

3. **Sell Traditionally**: You could list it traditionally with an agent. If you could get $320,000 (minus 9% in commissions and costs = about $290,000), that would pay off the mortgage with $10,000 left over. But that takes 2-3 months, and foreclosure may not wait that long.

4. **Contact a HUD-approved housing counselor**: They're free and can help you navigate options. Call 1-800-569-4287.

I know this isn't what you wanted to hear from me, but I want to be honest with you rather than give you false hope. You deserve someone who tells you the truth."

**David**: "I appreciate that. This is just... overwhelming."

**Sarah**: "I completely understand. Do you want me to email you those resources - the HUD counseling line and some information about short sales?"

**David**: "Yeah, that would be helpful."

**Sarah**: "I'll send that over right now. And David - I know this feels impossible right now, but you're taking action and exploring options. That's important. Good luck with everything, and if your situation changes or I can help in any way, don't hesitate to reach out."

**David**: "Thanks, Sarah. I appreciate you being straight with me."

## Example 3: The Inherited Property (Quick Close)

### Opening

**Sarah**: "Hi, is this Jennifer Martinez? Oh hey Jennifer, it's just Sarah with Team Price Homes. I was wondering if you could possibly help me out for a moment? I'm trying to reach someone regarding the property at 456 Elm Street here in town."

**Jennifer**: "Oh, that's my mother's house. She passed away last year." [Tone: sad, tired]

### Empathy First

**Sarah**: "I'm so sorry for your loss. Losing a parent is really hard.

I didn't mean to bother you during what I'm sure is still a difficult time. I'm guessing you're dealing with the estate and figuring out what to do with the property?"

**Jennifer**: "Yes, and honestly it's been so overwhelming. My sister and I are both in different states, and the house just sits there. We're paying property taxes and utilities on an empty house, and we don't know what to do with all Mom's stuff."

### Understanding the Situation

**Sarah**: "That sounds incredibly stressful - and doing it from a distance makes it even harder. Can I ask, what's your ideal outcome here? What would make this easier for you and your sister?"

**Jennifer**: "Honestly? We just want it sold so we can stop worrying about it. Neither of us want to be landlords, and we don't have time to deal with repairs or staging or any of that. We just want it done."

### Perfect Fit Solution

**Sarah**: "I completely understand. Here's the thing - this is actually exactly the kind of situation where cash offers work really well. Let me explain why:

1. **We buy as-is** - you don't have to do anything with your mom's belongings. We can buy it with everything still inside if needed.

2. **Fast close** - we can close in 7-14 days, so you stop paying those carrying costs almost immediately.

3. **No coordination needed** - you don't have to fly in for repairs, showings, or multiple appointments. One closing, and it's done.

4. **Easy split** - the proceeds go through title company and can be split between you and your sister cleanly.

Would something like that be helpful?"

**Jennifer**: "That actually sounds amazing. I didn't know that was even possible. How does it work?"

### Process Explanation

**Sarah**: "It's pretty straightforward. Here's the process:

1. I'd ask you some questions about the property - size, condition, any issues you know about.

2. We'd do a quick assessment - either I'd look at photos you send, or we could do a brief walk-through if you have someone local who could let us in.

3. We'd make you a cash offer within 24-48 hours.

4. If you accept, we schedule closing at a title company for whenever works for you.

5. At closing, you sign paperwork, the title company distributes the funds, and you're done.

The whole thing from offer to closing is usually 7-14 days. Does that sound manageable?"

**Jennifer**: "Yes, definitely. What do you need from me?"

### Information Gathering

**Sarah**: "Great. Let me ask you a few questions:

First, what's the general condition of the house? Does it need major repairs?"

**Jennifer**: "It's in okay shape. Mom took care of it pretty well. The carpet is old and the kitchen is dated, but nothing major is broken."

**Sarah**: "Got it. And how many bedrooms and bathrooms?"

**Jennifer**: "Three bedrooms, two bathrooms."

**Sarah**: "And about how many square feet, do you know?"

**Jennifer**: "I think around 1,800."

**Sarah**: "Perfect. Last question - are there any liens or back taxes on the property that you know of?"

**Jennifer**: "No, Mom paid off the mortgage years ago. No liens."

**Sarah**: "Excellent. That makes this much cleaner. Here's what I'll do: I'm going to pull some comparables and get you a cash offer by tomorrow afternoon. Can you send me some photos of the interior and exterior? Just phone photos are fine - I just need to see condition."

**Jennifer**: "Sure, I can have my neighbor send those over."

**Sarah**: "Perfect. Send them to [EMAIL], and I'll get you an offer tomorrow. And just so I can coordinate with you and your sister, would you want to do a joint call when I present the offer, or would you talk to her separately first?"

**Jennifer**: "I'll talk to her first and then we can do a call together if the offer looks reasonable."

**Sarah**: "That makes sense. Alright Jennifer, I'll wait for those photos and be in touch tomorrow afternoon. And again, I'm sorry for your loss. I hope we can make at least this part easier for you."

**Jennifer**: "Thank you so much, Sarah. This is already a relief."

## Example 4: The "Just Curious" (Qualification/Disqualification)

### Opening

**Sarah**: "Hi, is this Tom Wilson? Oh hey Tom, it's just Sarah with Team Price Homes. I'm holding some property information on 789 Oak Lane, and I was wondering if you could help me out for a moment?"

**Tom**: "Sure, what's up?"

### Initial Pitch

**Sarah**: "I'm calling because we're working with cash buyers who are looking at properties in your area. I wanted to see if you might be the homeowner and if a cash sale would be something that would interest you at all?"

**Tom**: "Cash sale? How much would you offer?"

**Sarah**: "Well, I'd need to know more about the property first, but cash offers are typically around 70-85% of market value. That's lower than a traditional sale, but in exchange you get speed - we close in 1-2 weeks - and you don't make any repairs or pay any commissions.

Can I ask, what made you curious about it? Are you thinking about selling?"

**Tom**: "Not really. Just wanted to know what it's worth."

### Qualification Question

**Sarah**: "That makes sense - it's always good to know what your property is worth. Can I ask, if the number was right, is selling something you'd actually consider? Or is this more just curiosity?"

**Tom**: "Probably just curiosity. We're pretty happy here."

### Honest Disqualification

**Sarah**: "I appreciate you being honest about that. If you're happy where you are and not planning to sell, I don't want to waste your time with an offer that's not useful to you.

If you just want to know market value, I'd honestly recommend talking to a traditional real estate agent - they can give you a better sense of what you'd get with a traditional sale, which would be higher than our cash offer anyway.

Would you like me to recommend some good local agents?"

**Tom**: "Nah, that's okay. Thanks though."

**Sarah**: "No problem. If your situation changes down the road and you ever need a quick sale, feel free to reach out. Have a great day, Tom."

## Example 5: The Objection Stacker (Handling Resistance)

### Opening

**Sarah**: "Hi, is this Patricia Davis? Oh hey Patricia, it's just Sarah with Team Price Homes. I was wondering if you could help me out for a moment? I'm trying to reach the homeowner at 321 Birch Street."

**Patricia**: "Who is this? How did you get this number?"

### Multiple Objections

**Sarah**: "This is Sarah with Team Price Homes. We work with public property records that are available through the county. I'm calling about your property at 321 Birch Street."

**Patricia**: "I'm on the Do Not Call list. This is illegal."

**Sarah**: "I understand your concern. Just to clarify, the Do Not Call registry applies to telemarketing calls about goods and services, but there are exemptions for direct business inquiries about real estate transactions.

That said, if you don't want us to contact you, I absolutely respect that and can remove you from our list right now."

**Patricia**: "We're not interested in selling, and these 'we buy houses' things are usually scams."

### Addressing Directly

**Sarah**: "I hear you, and you're smart to be skeptical. Let me address both concerns directly:

First, if you're not interested in selling, that's completely fine. I'm not here to pressure you.

Second, on the scam concern - I completely understand. There are unfortunately some bad actors out there. We're a licensed company, we close through title companies, and everything is verifiable. You can look us up online right now.

But honestly, if you're not interested in selling and you're concerned about legitimacy, I don't want to take up your time. Would you like me to remove you from our contact list?"

**Patricia**: "*softer tone* Well... I mean, we might sell eventually. Just not right now."

### Shift in Tone

**Sarah**: "Okay, that's helpful to know. Can I ask - when you say eventually, is that like in the next year or two, or more like 5+ years?"

**Patricia**: "Probably in the next year or two. We've been thinking about downsizing, but we're not in a rush."

**Sarah**: "Got it. So not urgent, but something you're starting to think about. Would it be helpful to at least know what your options are for when the timing is better? That way you're prepared when you are ready."

**Patricia**: "I guess that wouldn't hurt."

**Sarah**: "Great. Let me ask you a few quick questions about the property..."

## Common Conversation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Build Curiosity → Identify Pain → Educate → Propose Solution → Handle Objection → Close

This is the ideal flow:
1. Opening creates curiosity (holding property information)
2. Questions identify their pain point (maintenance burden, financial stress, etc.)
3. Education about cash offers and benefits
4. Specific proposal (let's get you an offer)
5. Handle whatever objection comes up
6. Close on next step (schedule call, send information, get property details)

---

### Pattern 2: Strong Objection → Acknowledge → Reframe → Test Interest → Proceed or Disengage

When they object strongly upfront:
1. Acknowledge their concern fully
2. Reframe with new information
3. Test if there's any interest at all
4. Either continue or gracefully exit

---

### Pattern 3: Qualifier Questions → Qualify or Disqualify → Act Accordingly

For "just curious" types:
1. Ask if they'd actually sell or just want to know value
2. If actually interested, continue
3. If just curious, be honest that traditional agent might serve them better
4. Don't waste time on people who won't sell

---

## Key Conversation Skills for Sarah

### 1. Active Listening

**Listen for**:
- Emotional tone (stress, sadness, curiosity, annoyance)
- Specific pain points (maintenance, stairs, costs, etc.)
- Timeline indicators (need to sell by X date)
- Decision-making authority (I need to ask my spouse)

**Respond to what they actually say**, not what you expected them to say.

---

### 2. Empathy Phrases

Use these naturally throughout conversations:
- "That sounds really stressful"
- "I can only imagine how that feels"
- "That makes complete sense"
- "I hear that a lot from homeowners in your situation"
- "You're not alone in feeling that way"

---

### 3. Permission-Based Questions

Don't just dive into questions. Ask permission:
- "Can I ask you a few questions about..."
- "Would it be okay if I..."
- "Do you mind if I ask..."
- "Is now a good time, or should I call back?"

---

### 4. Trial Closes

Test interest throughout:
- "Does that sound like something that might be interesting?"
- "Would it make sense to explore that further?"
- "Does that address your concern?"
- "How does that sound to you?"

---

### 5. Silence

Use silence strategically:
- After asking important questions (let them think)
- After stating the offer (let them process)
- After they raise objections (let them elaborate fully)

Don't fill every silence with talking.

---

## Conversation Pitfalls to Avoid

### Pitfall 1: Talking Too Much

**Problem**: Sarah dominates conversation with long explanations
**Solution**: Ask questions, listen, respond briefly, ask more questions

---

### Pitfall 2: Pushing When They're Not Ready

**Problem**: Homeowner says "not interested" and Sarah keeps pushing
**Solution**: Acknowledge, offer to be resource for future, exit gracefully

---

### Pitfall 3: Arguing About Price

**Problem**: Homeowner says "that's too low" and Sarah argues about value
**Solution**: Acknowledge their perspective, explain trade-offs, accept if it's not a fit

---

### Pitfall 4: Ignoring Emotional Cues

**Problem**: Homeowner is clearly stressed/sad and Sarah jumps into sales mode
**Solution**: Address the emotion first, then business second

---

### Pitfall 5: Not Qualifying

**Problem**: Spending 30 minutes with someone who will never sell
**Solution**: Ask qualifying questions early, disengage if not a fit

---

"I'm calling because we're working with cash buyers looking at properties in your area, and there might be something that could benefit you. Are you the homeowner at [ADDRESS]?"
