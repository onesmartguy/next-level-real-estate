link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjf5uhOMcTc&t=649s

hey do you notice when you cold call
0:01
your prospects and say hi my name is I'm
0:05
with XYZ company and the reason why I
0:07
called you was click or they say not
0:10
interested or we already have somebody
0:12
for that you know why the prospect is
0:15
doing that well if you don't I'm going
0:17
to show you why they're doing that in
0:19
their mind and then I'm going to show
0:21
you how to Rel language certain things
0:23
you're saying and how to use your tone
0:25
to get your prospect to let their guard
0:27
in come over here to my VI board now I
0:29
know most of you have been trained when
0:31
you cold call to do what what's the
0:33
standard pitch hi my name is James
0:38
Miller I'm with
0:40
ABC company whatever that is and the
0:43
reason why I called you was now I want
0:46
you to think about this for a second are
0:48
you the only person that's calling that
0:52
Prospect day in and day out cold calling
0:54
them you got to realize they're getting
0:56
cold calls from everybody that's selling
0:58
anything from maintenance equipment to
1:01
what you sell to you know cyber security
1:03
for their office it doesn't matter so
1:05
when they hear you say the same thing
1:08
that everybody else is saying that they
1:10
don't like when they turn down the other
1:12
salespeople what do you think is
1:14
happening in their mind their guard goes
1:16
up okay they go into what's called fight
1:18
ORF flight mode and they say they react
1:20
to you that's a what we would call a
1:22
defensive mechanism I'm not interested
1:24
we already have a vendor for that we
1:26
don't need that okay you're literally
1:29
triggering the resistance by the way
1:32
you've been taught how to talk to them
1:34
in that first 30 seconds are you with me
1:36
on that okay so what I'm going to do is
1:39
I'm going to show you how to Rel
1:41
language that and then how to lower your
1:43
tone to cause them to want to engage and
1:47
Trigger curiosity you might want to pay
1:49
attention to this this is going to be
1:50
really important here all right so the
1:51
first thing that we want to do when we
1:53
cold call is we want to trigger
1:56
curiosity in their mind so they actually
2:00
want to have a two-way conversation like
2:03
there's something you're going to say
2:05
and how you're going to say it and how
2:06
you're going to ask that's going to
2:08
cause them to open up okay I'm going to
2:10
show you some examples of that industry
2:12
specific ones and generic now this is
2:15
what we call a pattern interrupt now I
2:17
don't mean saying something weird or
2:20
like some type of joke or something like
2:23
that those very rarely work so be
2:26
careful of those so when I talk about
2:28
pattern interrupts is just a certain
2:31
question you're asking and I'm going to
2:32
show you up here that just causes them
2:35
to be like oh yeah that's us and what
2:37
we're going to do rather than going into
2:39
I represent ABC company and I'm calling
2:42
about our new XYZ software where you
2:44
start talking about your solution we're
2:47
going to talk about a problem or two
2:50
that most of those people answering can
2:52
identify with which then triggers
2:55
curiosity all right and then we're going
2:57
to do
2:58
it and I know some of you going to be
3:00
like Jeremy why would I do that you're
3:03
going to act confused in the beginning
3:06
not very long but in in the beginning of
3:09
that cold call where they actually come
3:12
to your rescue I actually called this
3:14
the confused old man technique now where
3:17
did I develop the confused old man
3:18
contique you see one of the industries I
3:20
sold in during my 177e sales career was
3:23
B2B and I was calling cold calling
3:27
prospects like you I was cold calling
3:29
SMB type of companies I was cold calling
3:32
even Enterprise level companies Fortune
3:34
500 and Fortune 1000 and I quickly
3:37
realized that if I sounded it like
3:39
everybody else that if I sounded sharp
3:41
and excited and right to the point that
3:44
the prospect viewed me like everybody
3:46
else cold calling them on a daily basis
3:49
and so I literally had no shot I had to
3:51
play the numbers game at that point I
3:53
don't want to play the numbers game
3:55
because you don't make that much money
3:57
playing the numbers game so I quickly
3:59
realized that if I acted kind of
4:00
confused like I wasn't quite sure who I
4:03
was supposed to be talking to that the
4:05
average person whether they were a
4:07
gatekeeper like a admin person or if
4:10
they were the individual I was supposed
4:11
to be talking to like a c-level
4:13
executive would actually come to my
4:15
rescue and tell me who I should be
4:17
talking to and actually transfer me to
4:19
them or if they were the person I was
4:21
reaching would say oh no I'm the person
4:23
you should be talking to and I'm going
4:24
to show you what I mean by acting like a
4:28
confused old man it's the confused tone
4:31
like I'm not quite sure confused tone
4:32
I'll show you in a second all right you
4:34
this will be interesting all right now
4:37
I'm going to give you a generic example
4:39
here so you can plug in what you sell to
4:42
this example and then right after I'm
4:44
going to do this you want to stay around
4:45
for this I'm going to give you two
4:48
completely different industry specific
4:50
examples where you can actually see the
4:52
framework in action I'm going to show
4:54
you how to do pattern interrupts all
4:55
right so let's say that uh somebody
4:58
answers the phone okay and I'm going to
5:00
show you my tone in this yeah is this is
5:03
uh is Jane there hey yeah Jane it's just
5:06
um James Miller with ABC company I was
5:08
wondering if you could possibly uh help
5:11
me out for a moment now let me talk
5:13
about what I just did there I'm going to
5:14
get a drink of
5:15
water and I'm actually going to do that
5:18
over because I want you to hear the
5:20
tongue my my voice is just I had no
5:22
water in there that cotton mouth all
5:24
right yeah is this Jane oh hey Jane it's
5:28
just uh Jeremy miners wonder if you
5:30
could possibly um help me out for a
5:32
moment now I want to show you what I
5:34
just did there okay what type of tone
5:37
did you hear me use okay that was a what
5:40
a
5:41
confused tone all right now why would I
5:44
use a confused tone there why would what
5:46
why wouldn't I just say hey this is
5:47
James Miller uh I'm with ABC company I
5:50
was wondering if you could help me out
5:51
for a moment because I would sound like
5:53
a what a salesperson trying to sell
5:56
something I don't want to sound like
5:57
that okay now why would I use the the
5:59
word J why would I say yeah it's it's
6:02
James Miller uh my yeah my name is it's
6:04
just James Miller why would I you say
6:06
Jess why would I almost downplay myself
6:08
there because you're probably taking
6:09
sales train like never use the word just
6:12
it implies that you're not important
6:15
well I hate to tell you on a cold call
6:18
when you're calling a prospect who has
6:20
no idea who you are from Adam or Eve you
6:23
have zero trust and zero credibility
6:26
they don't think you're important
6:27
already I hate to tell you that so by
6:30
using the word just primarily just cold
6:33
calls now inbound and outbound much
6:34
different examples okay but when you
6:36
cold call the word just implies what
6:40
that they should already know you yeah
6:42
it's just Uncle John calling you back
6:44
okay it's just like it's not a big deal
6:46
see I want them to feel like it's not a
6:48
big deal so they what lower their guard
6:52
okay they relax they don't put up the
6:54
guard where I have to compete with the
6:56
wall of sales resistance you see why I'm
6:58
using that okay I was wondering if you
7:00
could possibly um help me out for a
7:02
moment now when you do that with that
7:04
type of tone that confused tone you know
7:06
what most people will say they like uh
7:08
sure how can I help you or they'll say
7:10
like if they're really like in a bad
7:13
mood they'll be like uh sure how can I
7:14
help you who or who is this or what's
7:16
this all about most people will say
7:18
though uh sure how can I help you okay
7:21
like how can I help you because I'm
7:22
asking for help when an old man goes
7:25
into a grocery store and his GPS doesn't
7:27
work on his phone he's like ah I'm not
7:29
sure how to get to my daughter's home
7:32
everybody does what come to his help
7:34
because he's asking for help I'm using
7:37
human behavior I want to work with the
7:38
way the brain is already working now
7:40
let's look at the next part here I was
7:42
wonder if you could possibly um help me
7:44
out for a moment uh sure how can I help
7:46
you well and I'm not sure if you're the
7:49
right person I should be talking to but
7:52
I I call to see um who would be
7:54
responsible like in your company at
7:56
looking at any possible hidden Gap apps
7:59
in your blank that could be causing you
8:02
guys to blank um who should I be talking
8:05
to about that now let me analyze what I
8:08
just did there okay that is a generic
8:10
example all right now why would I say
8:12
even if the right person answered why
8:14
would I say well I'm not quite sure if
8:17
you're the right person I should be
8:19
talking to but I call to see who would
8:22
be responsible now why would I say
8:24
responsible who would be responsible in
8:27
your company now in this example this is
8:30
more of a smaller company if I'm calling
8:32
an Enterprise level company that has
8:34
thousands of employees I'm going to say
8:36
responsible in your department for
8:39
looking at any hidden Gap so a little
8:40
bit of a shift there this would be a
8:42
smaller company you'd say company if
8:44
it's a really really big company more
8:46
Enterprise you're going to use
8:48
Department okay if you sell B2B you know
8:51
what I mean by that okay at looking at
8:53
any possible now why would I say
8:54
possible why wouldn't I say looking at
8:56
Hidden gaps because they might say well
8:58
we don't have hidden gaps gaps but if I
9:00
say possible hidden gaps see that's a
9:03
neutral word possible hidden gaps that
9:06
causes them to think oh what what do you
9:09
mean by hidden gaps or do we have
9:11
something wrong it just seeds that there
9:13
could be something wrong okay that's all
9:15
I want I'm not trying to sell them with
9:17
this all I my job is to get them to let
9:20
their guard down where they open up and
9:22
have a two-way conversation that's my
9:25
only goal on that first part of that co-
9:26
call any possible hidden gaps in your
9:29
blank
9:29
now the blank will be determined about
9:31
what you sell let's say if you uh sell
9:34
like accounting services to small
9:36
business owners to help them with their
9:38
accounting so they don't overpay the IRS
9:41
with taxes I'm just throwing out
9:42
something any hidden gaps in like your
9:44
accounting like your uh you know your
9:47
accounting with what you guys are doing
9:48
that could be causing you guys to
9:50
overpay the IRS every year now if I said
9:54
that any possible hidden gaps in your
9:56
accounting that could be causing you to
9:59
overpay the IRS every year what do you
10:02
think that's going to do that's going to
10:04
trigger some curiosity how do you mean
10:06
by paying the IRS or how do you mean by
10:08
overpaying it's impossible for them not
10:12
to be curious at that point when I plug
10:14
in the negative consequence of the
10:18
possible hidden Gap in your blank that
10:21
could be now notice I didn't say is
10:25
could be why would I use the neutral
10:27
word there because could could be if I
10:30
get an A type personality I'm never
10:32
going to trigger that Prospect to say we
10:33
don't have any problems we don't have
10:35
any hidden gaps if I say could or
10:38
possible it's neutral it's a neutral
10:41
word all right and then at the end I say
10:43
who should I be talking to about that
10:45
now most of the time if you're talking
10:47
to the actual person they're like oh
10:48
that's me now why did they say that
10:50
because I said who would be responsible
10:52
for problem with negative consequence
10:55
it's hard for them to say oh that's not
10:57
me and try to transfer like almost
10:58
impossible possible because they could
11:00
get in trouble all right all right so
11:02
that's a generic example now there's
11:04
some offshoots of that okay and we train
11:07
all of that uh you know actually some of
11:10
you are probably wondering like how do I
11:12
how do I write these cold calls out for
11:14
my industry so if you're wondering about
11:16
that um why don't you go we'll let you
11:18
go to one of our Facebook groups you can
11:20
go to um sales revolution. proo go to
11:23
that one sales revolution. proo I think
11:25
there's like 85 90,000 uh people in
11:28
there and we do a lot more of this like
11:30
uh specific industry training in that
11:32
Facebook group so you're welcome to go
11:34
there if you want to U learn more about
11:35
cold calling for your industry all right
11:38
now you want me to show you a specific
11:40
industry right
11:41
here I can't get a water here just CAU
11:44
in mouth what are we going to do now
11:47
let's say that you sell SAS all right we
11:50
train thousands of salespeople in this
11:52
industry we train 158 different
11:54
Industries uh SAS is a big one for us as
11:57
well but let's say you have some type of
11:59
uh some software like a recruiting
12:01
software that helps trucking companies
12:04
okay this is a big industry that helps
12:06
trucking companies hire better truck
12:10
drivers because a big problem that they
12:12
have is they Place ads on indeed and
12:14
Linkedin and in different places and
12:16
they get kind of flaky people not really
12:19
uh LinkedIn but more indeed and they get
12:21
flaky drivers that then get hired and
12:24
you know after a week they're like oh I
12:25
don't want to do it and they quit and
12:27
when they quit guess what happens you
12:29
know that tractor trailer that big cargo
12:31
that they're hauling across the country
12:33
that they make money once they deliver
12:35
it well that's setting in their parking
12:37
lot now because nobody's driving it and
12:39
they're losing thousands of dollars a
12:41
day because they don't have enough
12:42
drivers to drive all the trucks and they
12:45
can't expand and hire more drivers uh
12:47
they can't get more trucks they can't
12:49
expand their business so it's a big
12:50
problem that this company that this
12:52
industry recruiting SAS solves for these
12:54
truck drivers they get much more
12:56
qualified candidates that last and
12:58
they're more experiened all right so
13:00
let's say in this example if I'm
13:02
typically calling a trucking company
13:05
most of the time that's going to go into
13:07
like some type of receptionist not all
13:09
the time but most of the time so let's
13:11
say that Wanda answers ABC company this
13:13
is Wanda how can I help you okay I'm
13:16
going to say this oh hey wand it's just
13:19
uh Jeremy miners wonder if you could
13:20
possibly um help me out for a moment uh
13:23
sure how can I help you Jeremy well and
13:25
I'm not sure who I should be um talking
13:28
to um I'm trying to reach the person who
13:31
would be uh responsible for like
13:34
overseeing like any possible hidden gaps
13:37
in like your advertising you know how to
13:39
hire like new truck drivers that could
13:42
be causing you guys to have to keep
13:44
several of your trucks you know vacant
13:46
every month who should I be talking to
13:48
about that now what do you think Wanda
13:51
is going to do notice I didn't talk
13:53
about my solution didn't talk about how
13:56
awesome it was or do you have two
13:57
minutes of of your time can I can I take
13:59
too much of your time to talk about our
14:01
ABC wonderful thing nobody cares about
14:03
that any over now what did I do the
14:06
person who's responsible for overseeing
14:09
so I just said something different okay
14:11
I can tweak this overseeing any possible
14:13
hidden gaps that triggers what do they a
14:16
lot of times you're going to get
14:18
prospects to say oh what do you mean by
14:19
hidden gaps and that's what I want
14:21
hidden gaps in your advertising for new
14:24
drivers that could be causing the firm
14:27
to have to keep several trucks
14:29
vacant every month who should I be
14:31
talking to see that's the problem
14:34
advertising for new drivers okay the the
14:36
thing that they do and then the
14:38
consequence is they're having to keep
14:40
several trucks vacant every month which
14:43
she would know is costing them tens of
14:45
thousands of dollars a day in Lost
14:47
revenue and then I say who should I be
14:49
talking to about that you're going to be
14:51
surprised most will be like oh that's
14:53
Jim over in shipping or that's uh Harry
14:56
over in human resources or whatever now
14:59
you don't want to say okay can I talk to
15:01
him because then they'll say do you have
15:03
a scheduled appointment a lot so I'm
15:04
going to show you an easier way a much
15:06
softer way to get her to transfer you
15:09
over to Jim or Sally's office number
15:12
well um should I have you transfer me
15:15
over to her to I guess leave a voicemail
15:18
and she can just call me back if she
15:20
needs some help with
15:22
that see how easy I made that for Wanda
15:26
well now I'm acting confused again okay
15:29
well should I have you transfer me over
15:31
to her to leave a voicemail now why
15:34
would I say leave a voicemail rather
15:35
than should I have you transfer me over
15:38
to her so I can talk to her about
15:41
ABC because leaving a voice message
15:43
seems much more easier for Wanda to do
15:46
now if she's transfering me over to
15:49
Sally and Sally's there I wouldn't leave
15:52
a voicemail cuz Sally's picking up the
15:54
phone you see what I'm doing there I my
15:56
goal is not to leave a voicemail but my
15:58
goal is to have her transfer me over to
16:00
Sally's phone because if Sally's in the
16:02
office she's going to answer the phone
16:03
if she's not then I'm going to leave a
16:05
voicemail and that's a whole another
16:06
training all right and then I said and
16:08
she can call me back if she needs help
16:11
see no pressure that's what I'm trying
16:14
to do keep the guard down you're going
16:16
to be shocked here you're going to have
16:18
like nine out of 10 wandas be like oh
16:20
sure I can transfer you over too that's
16:22
probably not a problem and you
16:23
transferred right over see how that
16:25
helps all right you want me to show you
16:26
another example okay so this is another
16:28
industry specific example let's say that
16:30
you sell real estate you're a real
16:31
estate investor okay you know those
16:34
distressed properties you always see
16:35
those signs on the road that says hey uh
16:37
we'll buy your home 30 days for cash
16:40
guaranteed or you see the Billboards or
16:41
you get the numbers okay we train
16:43
thousands in this space as well now I'm
16:45
going to show you how to trigger
16:48
engagement and I'm going to show you a
16:49
different way to do this I think you'll
16:51
find this actually quite fascinating uh
16:55
stay right there Nick I'm going to come
16:56
back I've got to get some documents here
16:58
just to show everybody what I'm going to
16:59
do because I think they're going to be
17:01
like oh my gosh I can't believe he's
17:03
doing that all right so here's what I'm
17:05
going to show you how to do so all right
17:07
in this example I'm going to show you an
17:10
example of a pattern interrupt and you
17:11
can do this in any industry but we would
17:13
just obviously reward this now if I'm a
17:16
real estate investor the advantage I
17:18
have to cold call here is in most
17:21
counties in Most states I can go print
17:23
off property tax records of the
17:27
homeowners that I'm cold calling does
17:29
that make sense so I want you to go to
17:31
your county most counties you can do
17:33
this there's a few you can't but 99% you
17:35
can and I literally want you to print
17:37
off the property tax records of every
17:40
single homeowner it's going to take you
17:42
some work but I promise you you're going
17:43
to make a lot of money if you do it of
17:45
every home that you're cold calling and
17:47
I and I want you to hold them in your
17:49
hand because this has to sound real you
17:51
don't want to fake it fake it to you
17:53
make it I don't want you to do that like
17:55
I literally want you to print off the
17:56
property counts tax records of the home
17:58
home owner your calling all right now
18:00
you're going to hold them in your hand
18:02
don't cheat it won't make any sense if
18:04
you don't why do I want you to hold them
18:06
in your hand because while you're cold
18:07
calling I'm going to have you shuffle
18:09
them around and they're going to hear
18:13
their property tax records being
18:15
shuffled around and what do you think
18:17
that's going to cause them to think
18:19
they're going to stay really engaged I
18:20
promise you it's very rare they ever
18:23
gonna hang up with you let me show you
18:24
what to do okay yeah hey is this Sally
18:27
is this Sally uh Hodes uh yeah this is
18:30
Sally who's this yeah it's just uh James
18:33
Miller I'm holding a I'm holding a copy
18:36
of your uh property tax records at your
18:40
property at uh looks like it's 55 5
18:43
Willow Lane there in Savannah and I was
18:45
wondering if you could possibly um help
18:47
me out for a
18:49
moment now how many prospects when you
18:53
cold call with their property tax
18:55
records and you say I'm holding a copy
18:57
of your property tax records at 55
19:00
Willow Lane how many of those people do
19:03
you think like are going to say not
19:06
interested when you're holding their
19:08
property tax records shuffling them in
19:10
your hand I'm going to go on a limb and
19:13
say zero unless you sound super salesy
19:15
and weird all right now I'm going to do
19:17
that again I want you to pay attention
19:18
to my tone what type of tone did I use a
19:21
confused tone that triggers curiosity
19:25
that triggers them to want to help me
19:27
hey is this is this uh Sally Jones oh
19:31
hey Sally it's uh it's just James Miller
19:34
I was I'm holding a copy of your
19:36
property tax records of your home at um
19:39
at the 55 Willow Lane I think there in
19:42
Montgomery and I was wondering if you
19:43
could possibly um help me out for a
19:45
moment you know what they're going to
19:46
say uh yeah sure how how can I help you
19:49
or what's this all about you know what's
19:50
going on in their mind they think it's
19:52
like the county commissioner with their
19:54
tax records that something could be
19:55
wrong so I promise you I can assure you
19:58
you it triggers massive curiosity okay
20:02
then I'm going to do this okay now my
20:04
biggest thing that I have to do here
20:07
after I do that opening statement is you
20:09
don't go into your sales pitch if you're
20:11
in that industry you're not going to be
20:12
like well hey I'm an investor and I
20:13
really like your home and I'd like to
20:15
make you an offer on it because they're
20:16
going to be like oh I don't want to sell
20:17
my home because you're going into your
20:19
solution too fast without triggering
20:22
engagement to then get into it all right
20:24
so let me show you what you're going to
20:25
do here your biggest thing you have to
20:28
do is get them to keep their guard down
20:31
if you can keep their guard down you get
20:33
into a two-way conversation it can be
20:35
very fruitful you can make a lot of
20:36
money and you get to help your prospects
20:38
solve their problems so here's what
20:39
you're going to do well and I'm not sure
20:42
if it really makes sense for us to to
20:44
even talk but I represent a group uh
20:48
that's buying they're buying like four
20:49
to five uh different properties and like
20:52
the kind of that three block area where
20:54
you're at there on Willow Lane and after
20:57
reviewing your your tax records here
21:00
especially on page three um I called to
21:03
see if you would be opposed to maybe
21:06
even having a brief conversation around
21:08
that because we we might actually be
21:10
able to do something for you and you're
21:13
going to go silent now you're going to
21:15
notice they're going to be like uh sure
21:18
or how did you get my property tax
21:20
records or yeah uh possibly but who are
21:22
you again now that's what I want because
21:27
that causes me now to be able to have a
21:29
two-way open conversation rather than
21:32
you like hi my name is I'm with XYZ
21:35
company the reason why I called you was
21:36
and you try to spit out as much
21:38
information and solution as you can and
21:41
hope and pray that they bite you don't
21:43
want to hope and pray that is not a
21:45
winning strategy so I'm going to do that
21:46
again I want you to hear what I did here
21:48
it's very important for you all right so
21:50
I'm going to go through the whole thing
21:51
again I'm going to get a drink of water
21:53
here CU I'm losing my
21:55
voice sh so many videos today for you
21:58
guys you're welcome by the way I think
21:59
you're going to enjoy this one all right
22:01
so you're going to print off the tax
22:02
records yeah is this um is this uh Sally
22:05
Jones oh yeah hey Sally it's just James
22:08
Miller I'm holding a actually let's do
22:11
that over again I lost my voice okay all
22:13
right so I'm going to show you again how
22:15
to do this and I want you to pay
22:16
attention to my tone and how I'm pausing
22:19
and then I'm going to break down what I
22:20
did there okay yeah is this Sally Sally
22:23
Hodes yeah yeah Sally it's just James uh
22:26
Miller I'm holding a copy of your uh
22:29
property tax records at your home at the
22:31
uh 55 Willow Lane address and I was
22:34
wondering if you could possibly um help
22:36
me out for a moment sure how can I help
22:38
you or sure you've got my property tax
22:40
records what's going on well now you're
22:43
going to downplay it well and I'm not
22:45
even sure if it really even makes sense
22:47
for us to even talk but I represent a
22:49
group that's buying looks like it's four
22:52
homes in like that three block area by
22:54
the Willow Lane property and after kind
22:57
of going through your your tax records
22:59
on that property especially Page look
23:02
like three here um I called to see if
23:05
you guys would be opposed to having
23:06
maybe a brief conversation around that
23:09
home uh because we might actually have
23:11
something for you should should we have
23:13
a
23:14
conversation now it's very hard when I
23:17
say let me show you how to do this okay
23:19
why would I say well I'm not even sure
23:21
if it really makes sense for us to even
23:23
talk why would I say that because it
23:26
causes them to lower their guard if I
23:28
said I'm so excited you answer the phone
23:30
because I really like your home and I'd
23:31
like to buy it then you're going to get
23:34
oh well we're not we're not interested
23:35
in selling or well it depends on what
23:37
you offer but if I kind of push them
23:39
away well and I'm not even sure if it
23:42
really makes sense for us to even talk I
23:44
push them away they do what pull me back
23:47
in see how I'm doing that I'm not being
23:49
negative I'm saying well I'm not even
23:51
quite sure I'm like I don't know yet I'm
23:53
neutral so you don't want to be negative
23:55
but you don't want to be positive right
23:56
I want to I'm right in the middle I just
23:57
don't know yet right right I don't know
23:59
enough about the home I I just represent
24:01
a group now if you're if a real estate
24:03
investor you don't want to say I
24:04
represent a group of investors because
24:06
they might have been called 20 times and
24:08
they're saying I I'm with a group of
24:09
investors so I just say a group all
24:11
right a group that's buying looks like
24:14
it's four homes and it's I get three I
24:15
get very very specific not generalized
24:19
in a three block area by your Willow
24:21
Lane property and after reviewing your
24:24
tax records especially yeah here on page
24:27
three now why did I do that because now
24:30
they're wondering what what's on page
24:33
three property tax records it's
24:35
impossible for them to want to hang up
24:37
okay that's what I want all right and
24:39
after read your tax especially on page
24:41
three see notice how I slow down on that
24:44
home I called to see if you guys would
24:45
be opposed now why would I say opposed
24:48
why would I not say I was wondering if
24:50
you would be open because what does the
24:53
what does what do most human beings want
24:55
to say on a cold call no so if I say
24:59
opposed I want them to say no you'll
25:02
find a lot when you say I was wondering
25:04
if you would be opposed to having a
25:05
brief conversation around that most
25:07
people will say yeah I'm not opposed
25:09
what do you have it's hard for them to
25:11
say yes I'm opposed it's very hard
25:15
because they already want to say no so
25:16
like I said I'm using that to their
25:20
advantage of mine because I'm working
25:22
with their brain the way they're already
25:24
wanting to think I'm using no to get
25:26
them to say eventually yes see what I
25:29
did there having a brief conversation
25:31
around that now sometimes you can add
25:33
cuz we we might actually have something
25:35
for you should we have a conversation
25:38
okay might it's a neutral word does that
25:40
make sense now if you want to learn more
25:42
about that specific cold calling
25:43
techniques uh you're welcome to join one
25:45
of our Facebook groups sales revolution.
25:47
proo we do a lot more inside there hope
25:49
that helped you
